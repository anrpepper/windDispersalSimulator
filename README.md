# windDispersalSimulator

We publish here the R codes used to create forecasts of swarm migrations based solely on wind dispersal.  

The first codes (in [Rcodes](https://github.com/anrpepper/windDispersalSimulator/tree/master/Rcodes)) were used for the forecast published [here](https://locustcirad.wordpress.com/forecast/).

Please, note that these scripts may not work 'out of the box' and comments, help and improvements are welcome.  

Feel free to contact us.
